# Postfix-Expression-Calculator-Huge-Integer
Postfix Expression Calculator for Huge Integers. It can calculate expressions in postfix with huge numbers in just a few seconds.
## Main Features
- The Postfix expression calculation is one of the most used techniques to calculate mathematical calculations with parentheses. <br />
- It can calculate huge integers much faster. To see detailed information about Huge Integers and Their implementation, you can visit this link to take a look: <br />
**[Huge Integer Class Implementation](https://github.com/AbdullahMushtaq78/Huge-Integer-Big-Integer-Class-Immplemetation)**
- This postfix implementation also takes care of precedence of parenthesis. Like in this expression (3 + 5) * (99 * (10 - 8)), the (10 -8) will be calculated first and then others as well in exact order.
- All you have to do is pass some big numbers with valid parenthesis and operators like + - * /, and you will get the answer in seconds. <br />
