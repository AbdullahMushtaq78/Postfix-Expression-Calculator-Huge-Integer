# Postfix-Expression-Calculator-Huge-Integer
Postfix Expression Calculator for Huge Integers. It can calculate expressions in postfix with huge numbers in just few seconds.
## Main Features
- The Postfix expression calcualtion is one of the mostly used technique to calculate the mathematical calculations with paranthesis. <br />
- It can calculate the huge integers much faster. In order to see a detailed information about Huge Integers and Their implementation you can visit this link to take a look: <br />
**[Huge Integer Class Implementation](https://github.com/AbdullahMushtaq78/Huge-Integer-Big-Integer-Class-Immplemetation)**
- This postfix implementation also takes care of precendence of paranthesis. Like in this expression (3 + 5) * (99 * (10 - 8)) , the (10 -8) will be calculated first and then others as well in same order.
- All you had to do is just pass some big numbers with valid paranthesis and operators like + - * / and you will get the answer in seconds. <br />
